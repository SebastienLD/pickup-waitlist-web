This is web repo for my basketball pickup waitlist project. The goal of the project is to modernize the way you "call next" at your local gym. By loging into the site, you can see what teams are currently playing, what teams are waiting to play, and you can decide to join an existing team or create your own.

Framework used on the frontend: Next.js

Learn more about the backend here: https://github.com/SebastienLD/pickup-waitlist-backend

I'm currently using vercel to deploy/host this frontend Next app, and Heroku to host my backend api + Postgres database.
